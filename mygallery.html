    <td><b><i> crackhead</i> \^0^/</b><br>This is my university friends. I started getting to know them from semester 1 again which is in october 2020, but I got to know them online because the pandemic started then. After 2 years of studying by ODL, we finally met on campus. It was because we were instructed to return to campus because face -to -face classes would be conducted. So far I like to be friends with them even though we come from different states. Diana and Adina from Kuala Lumpur, Zulfa and Hani from Penang, Aqilah from Kedah and Farah from Perlis. since we are not sure if we will meet again or not for a degree later, I hope we can create as many memories as possible :") </td>
